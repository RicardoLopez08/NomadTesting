# NomadTestingSuite
Nomad is a Graphic User Interface that allows the user to click buttons and run
tests on the Nomad site on Alpha and RC. That way non-programmers can blackbox the site.

What is blackboxing you may be asking?
Blackboxing is when someone tests something without going into the code. It is
everything they need right in front of them. Like a Thermostat and clicking the
buttons on it instead of plugging your laptop in to see what the functions are.

## Getting Started

## Selenium Web Driver
Selenium Web Driver is a download as a JAR and a IDE that is integrated with Mozilla.
Mostly Mozilla services we are going to use. The IDE is pretty simple to use, just open
it up and start clicking and typing things up. There are some tricky things to find, but
I will show you around them.
